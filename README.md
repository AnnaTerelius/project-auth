# Project Auth

Anna and Elins project on how to sign up a new user and log in a user. How to create a authorize function.

## The problem

We started do build a sign up form, were the user should sign up with name, email and password. The password gets encrypted and a token is connected to the user.
Then we created a Sign in function were you should log in with you email and password still encrypted and end up on a member page were you can log out.
